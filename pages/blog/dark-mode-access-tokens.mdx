## Dark Mode

If you've logged into the queue recently, you may have noticed there is a new toggle near the logout button. Clicking this will enable our new highly sought-after feature - dark mode! We hope being on the queue will no longer burn out your eyes (just your soul).

## Access Tokens

The philosphy behind the Queue has always been to make it programmable and developer-first, which could enable integrations with services like PrairieLearn and the CBTF. To bring us closer to that goal, we recently rolled out [programmatic access control](/blog/confidential-queues-programmatic-admission-control), and now: access tokens!

Access tokens can be managed through the user settings page (which can be accessed by clicking on your name, next to the logout button). These tokens allow you to access the API as if you were logged in through the website. As such, you should be careful about keeping your tokens private. With an access token, you can:

- Add yourself to the queue
- List all questions on a specific queue
- Manage access tokens
- Do anything else the web interface can do

Authenticating through an access token is simple: just append `?private_token=...` to the URL or use the `Private-Token` header.

For specifics about the API, check out [the API docs](https://github.com/illinois/queue/blob/master/doc/API.md).
