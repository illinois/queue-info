"Queue". It's in our name. Since our launch, this FIFO data structure has served us well as the foundation for the Queue experience.

However, we've received consistent feedback that queue waiting times are too long, especially in larger courses. Since students have to wait for every other student before them to be helped before they can be helped themselves, some students might have to wait two or three hours to get help!

Wouldn't it be great if you could get help as soon as you ask your question? Well, now you can.

We hope you're as excited about this change as we are. Happy April Fools'!
